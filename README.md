### ✯ Introduction

* Cricket is a globally celebrated sport with profound economic impacts, involving billions in revenue and extensive fan engagement.
* AI-driven data analytics is rapidly transforming cricket, offering new avenues for player development and strategic planning.
* This project focuses on classifying cricket shots from videos into distinct categories and exploring the similarities between these shots.
* By leveraging these insights, players can enhance their skills, and coaches can identify promising new talent more effectively.

</p>

* Dataset sourced from CrickShot10 authors [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350998665_CricShotClassify_An_Approach_to_Classifying_Batting_Shots_from_Cricket_Videos_Using_a_Convolutional_Neural_Network_and_Gated_Recurrent_Unit).
* Removed score texts from videos for better shot analysis.
* Applied horizontal flips to represent different batting styles.
* Divided the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets with a 70-20-10 split for effective model evaluation.

* Utilizes a CNN-based feature extractor from the EfficientNet family, applied in a time-distributed block to maintain temporal information across video frames.
* Incorporates a Global Average Pooling layer within the time-distributed block to condense features.
* Employs GRU units to capture and analyze temporal dependencies between frames, enhancing the model's understanding of motion and sequence.
* Concludes with dense layers topped with a softmax activation for classifying shots into distinct categories based on learned features.

### ✯ Model Training

| Model               | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| EfficientNetB0      | 100%              | 85.80%              |
| EfficientNetV2B0    | 100%              | 77.01%              |
| EfficientNetB4      | 100%              | 72.86%              |

* Built three model variants, each with a distinct feature extractor head to evaluate performance variations.
* Trained all models for 20 epochs using batch sizes of 16, processing 30 frames per video to capture temporal dynamics.
* Utilized the Adam optimizer, configured with a learning rate of 0.001, to efficiently converge to optimal weights.
* Employed sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, for handling class labels as integers.

* Each individual in the population represents a set of model hyperparameters, such as learning rate and epochs.
* Individuals are assessed based on the validation accuracy of the model trained with their hyperparameters.
* Randomly selects small groups of individuals, with the best-performing individual from each group chosen to continue to the next generation.
* Combines and modifies selected individuals' hyperparameters to explore new solutions and improve model performance.
* The stagnation limit is set to 10, meaning the genetic algorithm halts if there's no improvement in the best fitness score after 10 consecutive generations.
* The learning rate ranges between 0.0001 and 0.02, and the epochs range from 1 to 20, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the hyperparameter space.

### ✯ Model Evaluation

| Model            | Testing Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| EfficientNetB0   | 94%              | 94%       | 94%    | 94%      |
| EfficientNetV2B0 | 81%              | 82%       | 81%    | 81%      |
| EfficientNetB4   | 74%              | 75%       | 74%    | 74%      |

* All three models were evaluated on the test set.
* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were the metrics used for evaluation.
* The model with EfficientNet B0 backbone outperformed the other two models.

* Extracted features from the convolutional block of the EfficientNet backbone, mapping them into a concise vector representation.
* Calculated cosine distance between feature vectors to assess similarities across different video inputs.
* Utilized this distance metric to determine the degree of similarity between two cricket shot videos.
* Confirmed model accuracy with a 100% similarity score for identical input videos, validating the effectiveness of the feature extraction and comparison approach.
